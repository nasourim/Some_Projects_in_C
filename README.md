# Some_Projects_in_C
C Projects that are good for practicing your C knowledge or teaching purposes<br/>

# Important
## Codes written for compiling and executing on windows machine, If you are using another OS you need to try avoid using getch() and use getchar() instead. <br/>
## I'll try to provide Readme and information for all the projects as soon as I can.<br/>
### But I really don't have enough time to make it possible, Any helps are welcome.<br/>

# Happy Coding
